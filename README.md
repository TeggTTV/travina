# Travina: Smart Travel Planner App

---

## üîê Overview

**Travina** is a travel itinerary app focused on trip optimization around personal connections, smart routes, and budget management. The idea: someone is visiting a friend in another city, they input the friend's address, and the app plans everything smartly around that point (lodging, routes, attractions, food, etc).

Primary platform is **mobile app** (React Native + Tailwind). Secondary platform is **marketing/landing website**.
